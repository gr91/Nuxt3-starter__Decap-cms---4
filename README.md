# Nuxt3 - Decap CMS boilerplate


**Live boilerplate example:** https://sailsnake-nuxt-decap-boilerplate.netlify.app


**Link to repo:** https://github.com/Sfolkerts89/Nuxt3-starter__Decap-cms

## A simple starting point

This boilerplate will get you going quick in building with Nuxt and Decap CMS. The base boilerplate consists out of the following:

### Decap CMS (config.yml)

* SEO anchor ready to go (simply use "- &seo" in any page/ file collection)

* Cloudinary support

### Pages

* Home page (this README content)

* A typography page with headings, paragraphs, list etc. to help you write your typography styles in one view

### Styling

* Minimal boilerplate styling

* Simple responsive GRID layout

* Categorized .scss files (main.scss, mixins.scss, type.scss, variables.scss etc.)

* variables.modules.scss which allows you to export your scss variables from variables.scss to be used in JS vars. Example: `const color = variables.myColor`

### Components

* A simplistic menu component which switches to a mobile menu in small viewports

* Layout components (logo, header, footer) already called in layout/default.vue

* A markdown render component that renders markdown to an HTML string server side (NOTE: it is harnessing an experimental feature 'islandComponents'; to remove set: nuxt.config.ts: islandComponents =>  false, remove the '.server' suffix from ParseMarkdown.server.vue)

### Composables:

* mdToHtml() composable: uses Nuxt/Content/MDC renderer. This first renders an HTML object from markdown input and returns the HTML object as a single string. This renders server side ;)

* setSeoHead() composable: just feed the SEOmetaData object (defined in config.yaml) from your api data; `setSeoHead(apiData.SEOmetaData)`

* useBtnData() composable: does an api call to /content/buttons.md and returns a single button string. Example `const buttonText = useBtnData('buttonsApi.readmore')` => result: `"hello! Read moar!"`. Conistent button text's throughout your site when using `slot` in a `button.vue` component

## Install

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/Sfolkerts89/Nuxt3-starter__Decap-cms.git` or click 'Use this template'

2. `yarn install` or `npm install`

4. Run frontend locally: `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`

3. Boot up Decap CMS locally:
  * uncomment `locale_backend: true` (*leave this out in production for safety's sake*)
  * run `npx decap-server`
  * Navigate to: localhost:3000/admin (asuming you have a frontend instance running)

## Netlify deployment
  * Build command: `npm run generate` (dont use YARN: Node will run out of memory)
  * Publish directory: `dist`

## Boilerplate__extras/ (folder)

I found it tough to decide wether to build an extranous boilerplate packed with features or to keep it clean and simple.. So i did both..
Addtional code snippets, components and more can be found in the folder 'boilerplate__extras'. If you want to start clean and simple, just delete the folder!


### /decap__config/

* basic 'products' collection (i.e. one level dynamic page names with a re-occuring content structure)

* Dynamic Fields using Yaml anchors (much like a page builder) which includes a carousel/lightbox option for mulitple images

* Dynamic Fields collection: code snippet that can be used as is and built upon/ changed to suite your needs.

### /nuxt__pages/

#### /product/ + [slug].vue

A simple dynamic page based of slug as a parameter set up as a 'products' page. This is in relation to the 'products' colleciton in boilerplate__extras/decap__config/

#### Contact.vue

Very simplistic contact page that includes the `<BasicInquery />' component. Place the 'forms' folder in a corresponding 'components' folder in your project and uncomment for use.

#### dynamic-fields.vue

A page that utlizes the `<dynamicFields />` component. This works in relation with:

* The Dynamic Fields anchor provided in: /decap__config/

* The Dynamic Fields collection provided in: /decap__config/

#### Products.vue

A simple page displays all the products in the products collection. 

### vue__components/forms/

In this folder you will find modular form building components. Along with a simple contact form that utilizes a few of these. 
Aside from being modular, the simple contact form has form input validation:

1. Input field validation happens in the child component

2. Child component emits validation data

3. Parent component pushes data in an array and checks if all entries are valid

### /vue__components/media/

#### Carousel.vue component with the following options via props:

* imageOnly (Boolean): enable only an array of image links are provided

* Slides (Array): image, caption

* Timed (Boolean): enables timedSlides() function, a slideshow if you will

* hasEnlarge: Enables an overlay on hover which allows for the carousel to enlarge to 100% of the container (full screen function)

* Color (String): provide a color value for carousel colored elements

#### RespImage.vue

Responsive image component based on Cloudinary transformations

##### Props

* url (String): set up for filename only i.e. `"my-image.jpg"`

* Lightbox (Boolean, default: false): enables lightbox function

* Objectfit (String, default: null): sets CSS object-fit property

* Color (String): passes color to lightbox accent color


##### RespVideo.vue

Responsive video component based on Cloudinary transformations

#### Props

* url (String): set up for filename only i.e. `"my-image.jpg"`

* hasSound (Boolean, default: null): sets muted property. If hasSound is set, video controls will appear to allow playback. Otherwise playback will `autoplay` (if autoplay is set to true)

* Autoplay (Boolean, default null): sets autoplay property when video is in view

* loop (Boolean, default null): Sets loop propery

* id (String):  the autoplay in view feature needs an element id to work. The video is is built using `:id` + `props.url.slice(-10)` (ensures unique id's per page)


### vue__components/misc/ (folder)

* DynamicFields.vue:
In here you will find the dynamicFields.vue component that corresponds with the 'dynamicFields.vue'. You will need this component to render the fields 'dynamic-fields' collection in dynamicFields.vue

* Copyright.vue:
A component displaying current year and your branding
